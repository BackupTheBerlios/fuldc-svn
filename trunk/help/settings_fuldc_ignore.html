		<h2>Ignore</h2>
		<p>Ignore function can be used to ignore private messages from bots or annoying 
			persons.</p>
		<p>If a user is ignored and you for some reason want to receive pm's from him/her you can 
			manually open a pm window, then all messages received after the window is opened will be 
			displayed.
			</p>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			<dl>
				<dt>List</dt>
				<dd>
					The list displays all users and patterns currently added to the ignore list.</dd>
				<dt>New...</dt>
				<dd>
					Opens up a new dialog window where a new pattern can be entered. The new 
					pattern can be either a full nick, wildcard or a regular expression. <br>wildcards 
					that can be used are ! for negation, * for matching several characters and ? to 
					match one character.<br><br> For example a wildcard match can look like Trem* which 
					will match Trem, Tremor, Trem0r and so on.<br><br> Regular Expressions are used in the 
					same way as in the rest of the program, they start with $Re: and then the 
					regular expression without a space after the :.
				</dd>
				<dt>Remove</dt>
				<dd>
					Removes all selected items from the list.</dd>
