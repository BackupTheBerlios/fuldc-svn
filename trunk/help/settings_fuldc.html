		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			<dl>

				<dd>
					This option splits the mainchat logs in to smaller log files. A new file 
					is created every day and named after the current date.</dd>

				<dt>confirm removal of files from queue</dt>

					If enabled a dialog box will pop up asking if you really want to remove the files.</dd>
				<dt>play custom sounds on PM</dt>

					play those sounds when receiving private messages instead of the default sounds.</dd>
				<dt>Remove topic (everywhere except hub window title)</dt>
				<dd>
					Removes everything after the last - found in the hub name. Enable this to get a 
					cleaner look everywhere except hub window title.</dd>

				<dd>
					If this is activated, clicking on an active tab will deactivate that window 
					and activate the next window in the tab order.</dd>
				<dt>Drop connections from own nick(stupid clients)</dt>
				<dd>
					If you're seeing connection attempts from your own nick and it bothers you, 
					activate this function to drop those connections. If logging of system messages 
					is enabled, a log entry will be created in system.log.</dd>
				<dt>Flash window on PM</dt>
				<dd>
					Flash window when a private message is received.</dd>
				<dt>Flash window on PM only if it's from a new user</dt>
				<dd>

				<dt>Ignore TTH inconsistency</dt>
				<dd>
					If you do not want to lose the slot when encountering a TTH inconsistency enable this 
					and the file will continue downloading. The file will probably be broken but at least 
					you get to keep the slot and it's easy to verify with sfv.</dd>

					is the url that should be opened when a web shortcut is used, specify %s in the url
					where the search term should be inserted. Clean search string is used to remove 
					info from the search string that's not necessary, for example 
					"Movie.Name.2003.DVDRip.XviD-ABC" will become "Movie Name"</dd>
